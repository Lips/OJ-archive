&lt;p&gt;One of my oldest friends is dying of ovarian cancer. It&#039;s hard to say or to type or to think but it&#039;s real and it&#039;s happening and it&#039;s on my mind every day. She is 28 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole and I first met in Cedar Lane, a high school for teens who have suffered trauma and abuse as children. We shared the same art class, although never even spoke until I was looking for someone to go see Joni Mitchell with at Merriweather Post Pavillion. She had the car and I had the tickets. Joni wasn&#039;t at her best. She was visibly tired singing classic jazz standards and playing with a 20 piece string section. Nicole and I were bummed as as we left, so we rolled the windows down and blasted &quot;Carey.&quot; Everyone in the parking lot started cheering and dancing. For a moment, we felt like celebrities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved in with Nicole and her family during my senior year of high school. My mother had recently relapsed on heroin and left behind a husband, three very young children, and me. Nicole&#039;s mother and brothers welcomed me into their home without a second thought. They bought me clothes, fed me and became my family.&lt;/p&gt;
