&lt;p&gt;Debe Dalton - Lives in Brooklyn&lt;br /&gt;
Kale Records, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A timeless album you will play over and over, good music for chilling in the afternoon or evening and good music for coming down in the morning. Stalwart Seeger and Newport treatments render a comfortable listen yet Dalton&#039;s activist wit and occasional pop flourish never let things get passive. Missed Opportunities, classic antifolk, chides the opportunism of the new folk revival. 52 Minutes comforts the doubt in the spiritual quest Seek and You Shall Find. Think Again recasts the Billy Bragg song of the same title from political to personal without losing any any urgency. (I Was) Quietly Playing Banjo (In the Park) sentiment and arrangement bite Kimya Dawson&#039;s Sorry Sometimes I&#039;m Mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Trip&lt;br /&gt;
Directed by Alison Ellwood &amp;amp; Alex Gibney&lt;br /&gt;
History Channel Films, 2011&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Yardsale - This Sat. and Sun. 8 am - 5 pm</title>
 <link>http://olivejuicemusic.com/blog/2012/09/06/yardsale-sat-and-sun-8-am-5-pm</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-type-filefield field-field-picture&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;picture:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img  class=&quot;imagefield imagefield-field_picture&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; title=&quot;goodbye southern death swing&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://olivejuicemusic.com/sites/default/files/blog/12/09/1904191164-1.jpg?1346987703&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sentence of the Yardsale blog. So first things first, follow this link to download the Major Matt e.p. Gooodbye Southern Death Swing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://yardsalerecords.bandcamp.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://yardsalerecords.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;http://yardsalerecords.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt; .So really first things first Yardsale is Dina&#039;s and I new record label, I recorded the songs at a sidewalk Cafe show and in Matt&#039;s living room on a Radio Shack Cassette Recorder, Nick Nace helped me clean up a really lofi recording and make it digital and Dina put it up on Yardsale Bandcamp, here is the link again  &lt;a href=&quot;http://yardsalerecords.bandcamp.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://yardsalerecords.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;http://yardsalerecords.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt; . The recording sounds authentic, and the songs are great. Some of the songs are songs Matt wrote and recorded a long time ago which I captured at the Postparade ramble. Drink the Blood is really great, and I mean a really great new song by Matt. I hope this is the only recording of it, I recorded a bunch of other new songs by Matt including Dolly, I couldn&#039;t add them to the ep because I haven&#039;t figured out how to control the tape speed and treble during playback. It would be cool if I could put out a bunch of lofi Matt eps. I&#039;ve got a Kansas State Flower rehearsal tape edited down from 3 hours of rehearsal tape to about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;picture:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img  class=&quot;imagefield imagefield-field_picture&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; title=&quot;the long ryders&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://olivejuicemusic.com/sites/default/files/blog/11/12/the%20long%20riders.jpg?1324699335&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m in the used record store on 81st and Broadway looking at records. I like this store because everything is relatively cheap, especially the post 60&#039;s stuff, and there always a lot of Bob Dylan and Lou Reed records for completist fallback. So I&#039;m in the store and I&#039;m looking through records and another record buyer starts complaining that a budget copy of Abby Road costs 15 dollars. So I&#039;m thinking to myself well were surrounded by a Starbucks, a Barnes and Noble, a Best Buy, and a McDonalds.... I mean I would pay more taxes to keep this store open or at least pay $15.00 for a copy of a budget Abby Road, I&#039;m also thinking if you haven&#039;t listened to Abby Road 14 thousand times already you probably have very little interest in music let alone used records and if you were you would gladly pay $15 if you never listened to it before, because it&#039;s going to blow your mind, your gonna listen to it 14 thousand times, and your going to memorize every line, a bargain at $15. So then the used record complainer complains that he could get that in philadelphia for $10, and I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m getting tired of listening to this guy complain so thank god Jon walks into the store.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img  class=&quot;imagefield imagefield-field_picture&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; title=&quot;radio&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://olivejuicemusic.com/sites/default/files/blog/11/12/wnyu.jpg?1323655723&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my record collecting goals is to get every volume of the SYR series. I could listen to this stuff for hours and this is a long song (I could imagine the White Columns audience, some entranced, some looking around like when is this going to end). I wish I could write about this kind of music but I don&#039;t even know where to start, well maybe,...Glass, Cage...aaa...La Monte Young...and the guy who writes songs for guitar orchestras...Glenn Branca?...see what I mean. I was in Barnes and Noble in the 80&#039;s the other day and I was waiting in line at the register and an impulse buy book was a paperback guide to classical music. I seriously cannot listen to classical music, I totally don&#039;t get it, last time I was in a taxi I had to ask the driver to turn the classical music he was listening to off, it was driving me crazy. So I&#039;m reading the classical music guide and it turns out classical music guides are just like rock record guides. They list and critique the recordings, the songwriters, the musicians, the production, and add some contextual stuff to tie it together.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was the afternoon so I got a pint of Cherry Garcia and went home to listen to the radio and eat ice cream. I decided to be productive so I tuned into the New Afternoon Show. I love the New Afternoon Show. I wish it was the New 24 hours, 7 days a week show, so I wouldn&#039;t have to change the dial. I can&#039;t get WFMU uptown (what&#039;s up with that new transmitter?) so the only good music stations are CBS and The New Afternoon Show. The New Afternoon Show is challenging, they play all the new, most cred indie bands and labels in all the indie genres except hip-hop, hip hop has it&#039;s own show. I&#039;m also prepared to hear a lot of new things when I listen because if I think I have an in depth ear to the world of indie rock, I quickly realize I&#039;m only listening to the tip of the iceberg. I mean no joke the D.J.&#039;s and program manager are indie music genius. The first band on sounds like Confusion is Sex Sonic Youth, then some new wave lite bands. I hear a commercial for another show and the narrator sounds like Werner Herzog. I love his jungle movies. I saw Grizzly Man on Sundance and it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dirtbombs are playing at the Bell House and I&#039;m thinking of going. I&#039;ve been a fan of The Dirtbombs since the White Stripes Detroit craze. I&#039;ve seen them a couple of times and really enjoyed their shows. I have a bunch of their records and they&#039;re always a terrific listen. They have out a new triple 12 inch LP of detroit techno songs. ALthough they do a lot of original songs, The Dirtbombs are also musicologists, they also put out an LP of r&amp;amp;b and soul covers. So I call Matt to see if he wants to go. Matt tells me he&#039;s going to Brooklyn to see Christie&#039;s band play so I decided to go because I&#039;ve never seen her band play before. Actually no one has seen her band play before because this is their first show, they&#039;ve been rehearsing for a year and now they&#039;re doing a show. Matt and I get to the show and the band goes on and they&#039;re really good. Post rock, prog, instrumentals. I&#039;t always cool to hear some different styles of music you don&#039; t usually listen to. The music was dramatic my senses were really heightened plus there was a film of protest marchers projected behind the band so it was extra dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m going out to Emandee Studio to meet Dina and Matt to record some new songs. Matt is starting to do some recordings at Emandee so we&#039;re going to record some Prewar songs so Matt can get aquainted with the workings of the studio. So we&#039;re supposed to chill out together, take our time, work out some new songs in a new studio for us. Of course I stayed up all night the night before to churn out a bunch of new Prewar songs. I have a few melodies with only slight variations between them and about 10 sets of lyrics to mix and match. I tried to write fun lyrics for partying and stressed out lyrics for coming down and I&#039;m really trying to get everything uptempo. Speaking of stressed out, I am totally stressed out. I was up all night crunching lyrics and rewriting them all day and I&#039;m all hopped up on caffeine and really grouchy. I&#039;ll be lucky if I don&#039;t ruin the session. It&#039;s a long walk from the train so I&#039;m trying to keep it together till I get to Emandee where Dina and Matt will cheer me up. So I get there and Matt is inside, there&#039;s no buzzer so I call and he comes outside. He tells me Mark is going to come by to show us around the studio.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the train again out to Long Island again. It&#039;s Memorial Day I really have deep respect and empathy for those who  have lost their lives fighting for our freedom and protecting our country, but do I have to sit around all day at a bbq far from the streets of my beautiful city? So I&#039;m on the train and it is a long trip so it&#039;s a good time to go through a bunch of back issues of Deli Magazine. Deli Magazine doesn&#039;t come with a cassette sampler so it&#039;s good I have a computer with me because I can read about bands and then look up their music on myspace. Geezer on Diesel are new rock goth, updating Bauhaus, glam, Automatic, and Daydream.with a Strokesian finish. Best line &quot; If you&#039;re looking for an answer try Satan&quot;. The live song out Out on the Lake ( recorded live at Glasslands) is hard rock fun. At Waking Lights.com I watched the video for The Waking Lights song Our Time Will Come (Clean), Our Time Will Come (Clean) is a commercial pop song, I can hear it on AM radio, the Strokesian break ( God how influential are those guys) mint the bubblegum content. This video is on Indiegogo, their motto is D.I.Y. or Die, they raised $2,860, and they have 0 time left.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was teaching in a school in the Bronx and I was on a break, so I went over the Walgreens on Boston Road. It&#039;s residential there with a few stores and restaurants. I like going to Walgreens  because they have a good selection of mainstream magazines so I can chill out and read the reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin, and grab some chips and a soda. So it&#039;s Bob Dylan&#039;s 70th birthday this year so he&#039;s been on the cover of a lot of magazines so I&#039;ve been buying the ones I see on the newstand. I know it&#039;s an antifolk cliche and there&#039;s a lot of rewritten stuff but there&#039;s always some new arcane Bobby D. info someone uncovers. It&#039;s a cool excuse to buy different magazines that normally I just skim the reviews of and read the whole issue. So I&#039;m at Walgreens and I buy the Rolling Stone and it features the 70 greatest Dylan songs. It&#039;s kind of a corny idea, but I guess it&#039;s always cool to read what Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Keith Richards think about Bob. The greatest Dylan song is surprisingly Like A Rolling Stone and the 70th greatest Dylan is To Ramona. Rolling Stone also put out a special collecters edition, The 100 Greatest Artists of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s hot in more ways than one. It&#039;s 100 degrees out and I&#039;m done with work and tomorrow we have to go out to Long Island for Mother&#039;s Day. So I get off the 6 at 125th and I&#039;m not going to bus it west, make a cold drink, and settle in and see if Fox started their baseball coverage yet, instead I&#039;m going to hoof it west and do my Mother&#039;s Day and late birthday shopping. Whenever I go out to the island I&#039;m always shopping for some kind of late gift. I can never get things in the mail on time. So I pass Harlem Underground and there is a great Jimi Hendrix shirt in the window but I have a rule that when I&quot;m shopping for gifts I don&#039;t buy anything for myself so I pass. I am thirsty though so I want to get a juice. The juice place is totally so crowded so I go to the health food store a few doors down and get in line to order a juice. So there is only one person ahead of me so I figure I can order soon. The juicer is really slow and soon there is a long line behind me and the juicer is still making this one juice so I leave and go a few doors down and make fruitpunch/lemonade at Subway. So I leave Subway and I have to get gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
