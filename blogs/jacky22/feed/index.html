        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 3 and 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days were originally an e-mail to Greg and Ahndraya, but I wrote so much I figured it could save me time and be my next diary entry. (with some editing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment in Buffalo has been A +, the crowd not so big (maybe 40 people)- the turn out was probably hurt because there was another show in town-The Sadies and Jesse Sykes&lt;br /&gt;
We played Sugar City&lt;br /&gt;
And the folks there were super nice, probably one of the only US promoters who actually cooked us a dinner. (and had yummy brownies)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>USA Tour Diary 2011-It Feels Like I Got A Splinter Up My Thumbnail, Oh Wait I Did.  </title>

        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of tour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up early to move Jeff’s car before we leave for Rochester. When I reach for my socks my thumb brushes up against the coffee table and I get a long splinter up my fingernail. AAAAAAAAAAA. The pain. I rush to the bathroom and try and pull it out. I only manage to break off the tip. “AAAAAAAA, ow, ow, ow” Oh my fucking god, this is un-real.  My mom comes into the bathroom with some tweezers and quickly pulls out the splinter. What a mom! A real “Pro” - mom. Man. I take a couple advil. It hurts like hell. I run downstairs to move the car.&lt;/p&gt;

I inserted a bunch of photos, so it&#039;ll be a little difficult to cut and paste all of them.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Stockholm Something (Tour Daily 3)</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-type-filefield field-field-picture&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;picture:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img  class=&quot;imagefield imagefield-field_picture&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://olivejuicemusic.com/sites/default/files/blog/10/09/storsmorgastarta.jpg?1285318321&quot; /&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long drive to Stockholm from Copenhagen, listening to the Moth, This American Life and finally as we arrive the amazing “Private Press” band The Dandelines. “We’re the children of Sunshine, we come from god the father, we come on down from heaven, to seek our looooove”&lt;br /&gt;
Sung by a group of what sound like three 10 year old girls.&lt;br /&gt;
(“Private Press” is the newest “inside-tour-joke.”)&lt;br /&gt;
During the drive I spot a moose in a field. “Moose! Moose!” I yell. Waking up Jeff in the back who gets to see it as does Dave, who pops his moose-seeing-cherry (he’d never seen one before)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockholm is beautiful, but of course we have no time to see any of it. There’s a marathon happening. We’re playing another Debasser club, like we did in Malmo but this one is very stinky. But the food they serve is a lot better. Back in Debasser in Malmo we were served a classic Swedish dish, “The Sandwitch cake”  Look it up online. Smörgåstårta. “Like a very big multi-layer sandwich. Comes with many different fillings and toppings”  it was not for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malmo-Copenhagen (Tour Daily2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up this morning in a hostel and looked out the window to see a goat sticking its head out of it’s little house. Taking its time, not wanting to come outside.&lt;br /&gt;
It looks like a little farm just over the fence next to the hostel. Once one goat left his shack anothers head appeared in the doorway, eventually there were multiple goats walking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goteberg, Malmo, Oslo (Tour Daily 2010)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 September 2010 by lvov4bloogs | Edit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/7&lt;br /&gt;
I took 2 Tylenol PM before boarding our flight to Oslo., which allowed  me to sleep  for most of the 7 hour flight.  We landed in Oslo.&lt;br /&gt;
At the passport control we were a little nervous about saying we were playing shows even though we felt it is usually not a problem in Scandinavia. We went through separately. My customs officer asked if I was playing shows. I nervously said yes, in Sweden and then in Russia. “Oh” she said “that’s a big trip” “yeah I said and France and Italy” “That’s a lot of travel” she said&lt;br /&gt;
“Yes it is I said”&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled and stamped my passport.&lt;br /&gt;
The same happened with Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;
We rented a car. I felt pretty rested. We got a stick shift and tried practicing in the parking lot. I was having some trouble finding the sweet spot and the engine started smoking. Jeff drove it a round a little bit and it seemed okay, but then we had to go up a hill to exit and he kept stalling out. Quite stressful as we inched up the hill one stall out at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
