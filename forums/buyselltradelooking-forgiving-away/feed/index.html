 <title>Seeking to Swap Mattress: Bigger for Smaller</title>
 <link>http://olivejuicemusic.com/forum/2012/12/18/2055</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Does anyone want a king-sized mattress and are willing to swap their Queen or Full-sized mattress for my king-sized mattress (and box springs)? (No twins). I just inherited a king-size mattress from a trustworthy friend but we didn&#039;t have the strength to get it up the stairs! It&#039;s too big and heavy. I can see having a King-size being a recurring problem for me being it&#039;s so big and I&#039;m nomadic and usually occupying small spaces. If you&#039;re down we can arrange a swap party. Can anyone help? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn near Grand Army Plaza. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please contact me directly.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Mary&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:silverpeddle@gmail.com&quot;&gt;silverpeddle@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Guitar pedal?</title>
 <link>http://olivejuicemusic.com/forum/2012/12/07/2052</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking for a new one to try out. Not sure what. Phaser? Flanger? Probably not a delay. I&#039;m really into tones. Who&#039;s got a suggestion?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>I need a stand-up bass player</title>
 <link>http://olivejuicemusic.com/forum/2012/10/12/2021</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m starting a Motown cover band.  I have a good looking female jazz singer and a great male vocalist and rhythm guitar player on board.  I play lead guitar and can sing low harmonies.  All of us have been playing professionally.  I&#039;m looking to put together a band that get can get a crowd singing, dancing, drinking and tipping big.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m looking for a stand-up bass player with some jazz experience.  Doesn&#039;t have to have a degree or anything, just looking for someone who can stay tight and do a cool bass solo now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t have any gigs lined up, but places like the Red Lion on Bleecker would kill to book a band like this.  The agenda, of course, is to build a following, build chemistry and then slowly start working in our own original music and selling some merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hit me up if you&#039;re interested.  I&#039;m Steve.  302-559-8823.&lt;/p&gt;
