        <p>I stumbled across this video of Kathleen Hanna talking about how she inadvertently gifted Kurt Cobain the 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' title (okay, I read it on Pitchfork).</p>
<p>I'm not the world's biggest Hanna-fan. I've listened to some Bikini Kill/Le Tigre, &amp; know she was an architect of Riot Grrrl. She entered my consciousness because of the fact that she was responsible for Teen Spirit's title, and was the fuck-about pixie in the 'Bull in the Heather' video.</p>
<p>But I never knew she stripped to get herself through Evergreen college in the late 80s (Ted Bundy's stomping ground/era). She regales the crowd in this video with a tale of how; (04:46) when Bikini Kill's van broke down, she resorted to stripping to get it fixed. This eventually resulted in her taking to the stage while 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' played.</p>
<p>She plays this off as a: "this song followed me around, oh-me oh-my, wouldn't you just know it? Dumb-fucking luck!" kind of joke, but (here it comes) I just cannot for the life of me, understand how an intelligent feminist woman didn't see the shameful irony of that situation, and how anyone could reconcile feminism with stripping. Yes, I know of 'Sex-Positive Feminism' and how there are women out there who try and put an empowering spin on subjugating themselves to men in this (and other) fashions, but I just can't buy it.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a train of thought that interprets my prudish opinion as sexist, but I'm not biting. I have a female friend who is a professional, Dominatrix - She works from home, nothing of a sexual nature taking place including the way she dresses: now THAT situation I can buy as positioning the woman completely in the ascendency while the guy's own dick holds him hostage and he hands his money over.</p>
<p>I hope this post doesn't come-off as antagonistic - I know Schwervon! played the Kathleen Hanna tribute very recently, and that Nan is a proponent of Riot Grrrl/fan of Kathleen, and I was pleased to see that, but my overriding instinct was to decry &amp; raise a debate about this. Especially considering the 'Where are all the ladies at" post the other day.<br />

          Some initial thoughts about the New Julie Ruin        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I can for sure see what you mean. Any kind of charged language like some of the stuff in the Riot Girl Manifesto is bound to create some controversy and criticism of hypocrisy. I have to admit There were some things about seeing the "New" Julie Ruin project unveiled that kind of stuck in my throat a bit. number one: covering old Le Tigre and Bikini Kill songs and number two: having such a slick sounding backup band (including some very choppy looking studio musician types). I supposed the world will get a chance to judge on their own soon enough. </p>
<p>With that being said I really applaud her for not trying to just play the role of the pissed off Riot Girl Star that she made famous, so to speak. She rocked it like the Pro that she is. She was gracious, graceful, and down to earth. She mentioned her husband and she seemed genuinely connected to her band. </p>
<p>I find myself, though not totally sure I'm gonna be the biggest fan of the new Julie Ruin, really respecting her for the way she appears to be moving forward with her present musical career. My point is: People do not exist in a vacuum. I was just talking to some friends last night about how there was a time, when I was a young wanna be punk, I thought that acoustic guitars were for pussies and if you cared too much about the lyrics you were a pretentious hippy. Okay, I'm not even gonna act like I was as smart as KH at the same age but if I were given the opportunity to write a manifesto then I think I would be regretting a lot more in mine than she probably does in hers. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that by telling this story in the video you posted I feel like she really helps dispel some of the myths and indie rock folklore (and maybe even Feminism)  that surrounds some of this stuff. Let's face it. Kurt Cobain's not gonna do it.  She does not apologize for the idealism of youth but she at the same time does not deny her maturity and her present needs and desires to grow as an artist. I think it's brave, even though artistically not always my cup of tea, I give her props. I might add I still think she's as sexy as all hell and I'm not just talking about her looks. </p>

        <p>A woman should be able to do whatever she wants with her body.  If she needs money and is ok with getting naked, why should anyone else have an issue with that?  We should all be able to use our bodies and minds in any way we want as long as it is consensual. A person who is comfortable with their nudity is powerful.  That seems more feminist to me than being afraid to use your assets.</p>

          Article by a Female Stripper &amp; One Man&#039;s Ponderings        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>AlterNet / By Sarah Katherine Lewis<br />
<strong>Is Stripping a Feminist Act?</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/sex/51408/?page=1" title="http://www.alternet.org/sex/51408/?page=1">http://www.alternet.org/sex/51408/?page=1</a></p>
<p> The above article is a woman speaking for herself and I will leave that at that.<br />
 I can speak for myself, albeit briefly (hopefully).<br />
 Over the years I have noticed the trend in men's underwear ads, etc. (which can be seen on phone booths etc.) is for the men to have shaved chests.<br />
 I have often wondered how much, if any amount, I would have to be offered before I would do this. (We'll leave out the fact that while I am somewhat "ripped"-I say somewhat-I am, <strong>for one</strong>, too unmuscular to be offered this.)<br />
 "Hmm", I have wondered, "What if they offered me $5,000 and the shave &amp; shoot took one day? The chest hair would grow back and that would be almost 500 hours I would not have to spend putting  chicken back that someone decided not to buy--but I'd be playing in to that silly, fadish, no chest hair crap--probably for a compnay that would never release an ad with a woman with hair on her legs and one that probably has their clothes sewn in sweatshops."<br />
 It's a tough one, because a whore is a whore in a sense.<br />
 The only thing that comes to mind in defense of not doing it is the belief that there should be a way to fund your projects by cashing in on past projects or by doing work where you don't have to change anything about yourself first.<br />
 Also, not working for a company you would not patron, etc.<br />
 I would turn down Nike for instance, but Maggie's Organics--not sure.<br />
 It's possible I'd say no.<br />
 Possible.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>From what I've read, the issues I have with stripping, prostitution and the porn industry are issues with exploitation and workers rights. I support any person's right to do what they want with their body and would rather focus on organizations that aim to secure legal and employment rights for women and men in these industries. </p>
<p>That being said, I have heard some powerful and potentially enlightening arguments against these professions. I wouldn't want to chastise someone for criticizing these industries...they may help change someone's life who is really unhappy with what they are doing. There are plenty of notable porn actresses who have quit the industry and become activists. I'm not as familiar with the stripping industry.</p>
<p>I remember getting a lap dance in New Orleans about 12 years ago. My biker/L7 fan/teacher girlfriend at the time was thoroughly amused with this. I remember my two friends and I talking with the dancer briefly afterwards. She was a student, she seemed pretty confident in what she was doing, and between my friends and I she made about $100 in less than 15 minutes. Think of how condescending it would be for me to say, "I'm sorry, I'm not going to give you my business because I think you are not enlightened and are disrespecting yourself." Really. How would I be right in judging her like that? She knows what she's doing, she's doing her job, and I'm enough of an adult to separate a fantasy experience with how I interact with people on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>I wouldn't get a lap dance these days. I've changed and it's not something I'm interested in. Apparently the musician mentioned in the initial post has changed as well. So be it.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>To make $1,000 quickly, perhaps stripping was the most efficient way she saw to do it. She's not saying wow this was such a great thing to do. It was the thing to do at the time. Not everyone's choice, but so be it. Everything in life is so grey, there's never any clear black or white, no matter what your ideology. Sometimes when you're up against it, you make choices you wouldn't make if everything was perfect.  As long as no one is harmed by you or your actions why is it so bad.</p>

          Playing the &quot;mother&quot; card...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I too had read that piece by Sarah Katherine Lewis quite a few years ago, and I think her account of the outcome of working in that industry is much along the same lines of my thinking.</p>
<p>At the end of it, she states that the sole reasoning to her working in the sex industry was money. It didn't liberate her, or give one in the eye to sexist men. She just simply made lots of money.</p>
<p>And I think, this is where my moral feministic standards are offended.</p>
<p>For me it is a question of whether you put the importance of money above the importance of keeping the gender balance equal.</p>
<p>I come from a poor family, I've had to work since the moment I stepped out of school (at 16, as I'm from the UK).</p>
<p>I've been a waitress, stacked shelves, arranged shoes, served coffee, sorted through bags of dirty underwear to find things worth selling in a charity shop.</p>
<p>Not once, in all my many levels of poverty, have I thought I would offer my gender-specific attributes to make me some money. Especially not a quick-buck.</p>
<p>It's granted that today, as I write this, I am not as sexually viable (in the opinion of society) as I was when I was younger (say between 16-21) but in spite of my good looks and very feminine physique, I've known intrinsically all my life that gaining money, attention, gifts; anything, via the base concept that I'm acquiring those things because a man would like to insert his penis in to my vagina, is wholly wrong.</p>
<p>My mum would never class herself as a "feminist" in fact, in a strange, British, working-class mindset she would probably go as far as to say she hates feminists and they annoy her. However, she's far from conservative, too. She was a Bowie-loving, T-rexer who hung about with drag queens and gays in the early 1970s, when people in England were still under the impression this "sort" of person didn't even exist in their precious neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The thing is, she has subtly made me aware since an early age that you must never, as a woman, gain favour of any type by playing-up to the role of sexual object. She taught me that, again, subtly (I can not remember a single conversation directly covering these issues) as a woman, it is important to succeed in life using my mind, not my body. My creative skills, my intelligence, my understanding of the human race, anything other than my body.</p>
<p>I wish I had more time to write further on this subject, but being a mother I'm stuck for time right now. And that being said (I am reluctant to use the "mum" card), having a daughter, I can not foresee any reason why in her life she would have to work in the sex industry. I will bring her up to know that she is more than a walking pair of breasts, and that she is capable of completing any task a man can do. If she has to wait tables to make some money (like her mum had to do) let it be, and let her learn that although waiting tables isn't glamorous, it's a stepping-stone of experience to show her that she has to work hard in life to get to a position she is happy with. It's not as easy as whipping your baps out for a bunch of leering, animals.</p>

          Strippers and acid        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I could never tell a woman what to do with her body. Unless I'm paying by the hour (sorry...bad joke).  I could never tell a man either for that matter.  That being said whether you're a hooker or a professional football player I always considered jobs that rely mostly upon one's fleeting physicality a little bit of a . sticky wicket. </p>
<p>To me stripping for dollars is a bit like polygamy. I would never judge someone for doing it but in the long run I really don't feel like it's a good idea for any party involved. Commodifying physical intimacy or detaching it from love, in my opinion, is like taking too much acid. At the time if feels very progressive but you run the risk of causing some serious damage to you psyche that could hinder your capacity for love later in life. </p>
<p>With that being said I think there is such a thing as erotic dancing or burlesque that can be really awesome and empowering for some people. I think it's when you're really just banging it out for the bucks that things get tricky. But I've luckily never been in a situation where I might have been so hurting for money that I would even consider something like that. But everyone's got their price I suppose. That would be an interesting question. If not $1000 for your van how much would it take for you to take off your clothes in a room full of strangers?</p>

          the whole shebang thread        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>i really liked that article barry posted. it usually comes back to making a buck to survive. which is the sad truth of our society .<br />
money buys freedom to do the things you want to do. of course money is not the most important thing in life. but you need a little to survive and pay rent and eat.<br />
it also comes down to how you feel about your own body and sexuality and your upbringing and your skills and what you think your employment options are.  i cannot judge a woman for feeling like stripping is a viable way to make a buck if she is okay with it.<br />
And what if you had a daughter and she told you that she wanted to strip for a job? even though you didn't want her to? what if she saw nothing wrong with it and said she felt empowered by it? what would you tell her?<br />
the thing that bugs me is when people think women should have shame about choices they make. If they are not hurting anyone, why should they feel shame? </p>
<p>vincent mentioned up above that doesn't kathleen see the "shameful irony of that situation"<br />
-a situation of both stripping and being a feminist? why couldn't she be both?<br />
i think kathleen is aware of the difference between writing/talking about feminism and then dancing naked on a stage for money.<br />
But why couldn't dancing on a stage naked be a feminist act?<br />
What about the women-owned and operated Lusty Lady in Seattle?<br />
I read a book about that and it seemed like it turned the industry on its head a bit  - they had healthcare and really treated their staff well and women were running the whole business. interesting....</p>
<p>I think kathleen was pretty self-aware in that presentation and laughing it off a bit was her way of processing it. people are full of contradictions. i liked that she was so open and not ashamed about the fact she had done that because she knew that was a way she could get enough money to get herself back on the road doing what she loved.</p>
<p>i'm sure some people would ask me  "why do you temp for a huge corporation?"<br />
um, it's easy and i get paid well which enables me to do MORE OF THE THINGS I LOVE. i don't get paid enough at my art stuff yet to live off of it. i could see that strippers (or anyone who cares about something else more than their day job) would use the same argument.</p>
<p>my cousin did "go go dancing" for a while - at least that was my grandmother's polite word for stripping. and when K. told her that's what she'd been doing for money, my grandmother said "honey, you go be the best go go dancer you can be!"</p>

          sex work, stripping &amp; porn - not just for women        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>while I think a little longer on how I'm going to respond, would any of you have responded differently if the person involved in stripping/porn/prostitution was not a woman?  </p>
<p>what about men and transgender folks who do sex work, make porn, and strip?</p>
<p>also, in what ways do you imagine different states of "power" (especially in terms of gender), and what are the necessary conditions for "empowerment"?</p>
